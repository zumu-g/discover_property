# **Technical Architecture & Site Structure**

### ## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

Our architecture will be a modern, decoupled system prioritizing scalability, performance, and developer experience.

  * **Frontend:** A Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Single Page Application (SPA).
  * **Backend:** A robust API built on a modular, microservices-oriented pattern.
  * **Database:** A combination of a relational database for core data and a search engine for complex queries.
  * **Deployment:** Cloud-native on AWS for its comprehensive suite of managed services.

### ## üé® Frontend Structure

  * **Framework: Next.js (React)**
      * **Why:** This is the ideal choice. Its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities are **critical for SEO**, ensuring our listings are highly visible on Google. It also provides a fast initial page load, which is essential for user retention.
  * **Styling: Tailwind CSS**
      * **Why:** For building a custom, high-performance, and consistent design system without writing traditional CSS. It allows for rapid development of the clean, minimalist UI we require.
  * **State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) & Zustand**
      * **Why:** **TanStack Query** will manage all server state‚Äîfetching listings, suburb data, etc. Its sophisticated caching and refetching logic will make the application feel incredibly fast and responsive. **Zustand** will be used for minimal global client state, like user authentication status or the state of the search filter panel.
  * **Mapping Library: Mapbox GL JS**
      * **Why:** Superior to other options for its performance with large datasets (thousands of property pins), deep customization capabilities for map styling, and excellent interactivity.
  * **Component Library: shadcn/ui**
      * **Why:** Provides a set of beautifully designed, accessible, and unstyled components. This gives our developers a solid foundation for UI elements (forms, modals, buttons) while allowing our designers complete style control via Tailwind.

### ## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Structure

  * **Framework: NestJS (using TypeScript on Node.js)**
      * **Why:** NestJS enforces a structured, modular architecture that is perfect for building scalable and maintainable APIs. Its native TypeScript support ensures type safety across our entire backend.
  * **Database:**
      * **Primary Relational DB: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension**
          * **Why:** PostgreSQL is a robust and reliable relational database. The **PostGIS** extension is the industry standard for efficient geospatial queries, which is fundamental for our map-based search (e.g., "find all properties within the current map viewport").
      * **Search Engine: Elasticsearch**
          * **Why:** For powering fast, complex, and fault-tolerant search queries, including keyword searches and filter aggregations. Data will be continuously synced from PostgreSQL to Elasticsearch.
  * **API Architecture:**
      * **Primary: REST API**
          * **Why:** We will use a standard RESTful API for most CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to users, agents, and listings.
  * **Core Services (Microservices approach):**
      * `Listings Service`: Manages all property data, including ingestion from third-party agent feeds.
      * `Users Service`: Handles authentication, profiles for buyers/agents, and saved searches/shortlists.
      * `Search Service`: Interfaces with Elasticsearch to provide search results.
      * `Geospatial Service`: Handles all PostGIS queries for map-based functionality.

### ## üîê Infrastructure & Core Services

  * **Hosting & Deployment:**
      * **Frontend (Vercel):** The premier platform for hosting Next.js applications, offering seamless CI/CD and a global CDN.
      * **Backend & Database (Amazon Web Services - AWS):**
          * **Compute:** NestJS services will be deployed as Docker containers on a scalable platform like **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)**.
          * **Database:** We will use managed services: **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL** and **Amazon OpenSearch Service** (for Elasticsearch) to reduce operational overhead.
  * **Image & Media Handling: Amazon S3 & a CDN (Cloudinary)**
      * **Why:** **Amazon S3** will be used for scalable, durable storage of all property photos and videos. We will serve this media through a specialized CDN like **Cloudinary** to perform real-time image optimization, resizing, and format conversion, ensuring the fastest possible media delivery to users on any device.
  * **Authentication: Auth0**
      * **Why:** We will not build our own authentication. Auth0 provides a secure, enterprise-grade solution for user and agent login, social sign-on (Google, etc.), password management, and multi-factor authentication.
  * **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
      * **Why:** To onboard listings at scale, we must support automated data feeds from agency CRMs. We will build a serverless pipeline using **AWS Lambda** and **SQS** to process industry-standard XML/JSON feeds, validate the data, and insert it into our database.
