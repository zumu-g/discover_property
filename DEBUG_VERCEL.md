# Debug Vercel 404 Issue

## üîç Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Check Vercel Build Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Look at the **Build Logs** - paste them here if there are errors

### Step 2: Verify Current Vercel Settings
Screenshot or copy these settings from Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General:

```
Framework Preset: ________________
Root Directory: __________________
Build Command: ___________________
Output Directory: ________________
Install Command: _________________
Node.js Version: _________________
```

### Step 3: Check What Vercel Actually Deployed
1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Add `/api/hello` to the end - what happens?
3. Check browser developer tools ‚Üí Network tab when visiting the site

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Root Directory
- **Problem**: Root Directory is set to `.` instead of `frontend`
- **Solution**: Change to `frontend` in project settings

### Issue 2: Build Command Issues
- **Problem**: Turbopack not supported in Vercel environment
- **Solution**: Use standard `npm run build` (now fixed)

### Issue 3: Output Directory Wrong
- **Problem**: Vercel looking for `.next` in wrong location
- **Solution**: Should automatically detect with `frontend` root directory

### Issue 4: Node.js Version
- **Problem**: Using Node 16.x (outdated)
- **Solution**: Use Node 18.x or 20.x

## üîß Nuclear Option: Fresh Deployment

If nothing else works, try this completely fresh approach:

### Option A: Deploy from Frontend Folder Only

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** called `discover-property-frontend`
2. **Copy only the frontend folder contents** to the new repo:
   ```bash
   # Create new repo locally
   mkdir discover-property-frontend
   cd discover-property-frontend
   git init
   
   # Copy frontend files
   cp -r /path/to/discover_property/frontend/* .
   
   # Commit and push to new repo
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial frontend deployment"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/discover-property-frontend.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. **Deploy the new repo** to Vercel (much simpler)

### Option B: Use Different Deployment Service

If Vercel keeps failing, try:
- **Netlify**: Often simpler for Next.js monorepos
- **Railway**: Good for full-stack apps
- **Render**: Free tier with good Next.js support

## üìã Debugging Checklist

Mark each as you verify:

- [ ] Vercel Root Directory is set to `frontend`
- [ ] Framework is detected as `Next.js`
- [ ] Build command is `npm run build` (not with --turbopack)
- [ ] Node.js version is 18.x or 20.x
- [ ] Build logs show successful completion
- [ ] No environment variable errors in build
- [ ] `.next` folder is being generated correctly
- [ ] Static files are being output

## üéØ Expected Working Configuration

```json
{
  "Framework": "Next.js",
  "Root Directory": "frontend",
  "Build Command": "npm run build",
  "Output Directory": ".next",
  "Install Command": "npm ci",
  "Node.js Version": "18.x"
}
```

## üÜò If Still Broken

Send me:
1. Screenshot of Vercel project settings
2. Build log output from Vercel
3. Error message in browser console (F12)
4. The exact URL you're trying to access

I can then provide a targeted fix based on the specific error!
